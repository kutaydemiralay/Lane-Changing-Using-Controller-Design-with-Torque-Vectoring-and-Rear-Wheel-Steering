# Lane-Changing-Using-Controller-Design-with-Torque-Vectoring-and-Rear-Wheel-Steering
Lane-changing control using Model Predictive Control (MPC) with torque vectoring and rear-wheel steering. Simulates a linearized 4-wheel vehicle and uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for state estimation. Compares advanced actuation strategies for improved lateral tracking and stability.
